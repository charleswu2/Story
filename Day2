#Telling a story from user input

phone = 'You turn on your phone and start scrolling through your notifications, will you play 1 for a phone game, 2 for check the news, or 3 for turn on some music'
game = 'You open your newly downloaded flappy bird game and begin to try beating your high score of 32 tunnels passed. You are a determined person and you refuse to give up. After 3 hours have passed, the highest score that you’ve reached is 7. You begin to become frustrated and your eyes begin hurting. But that won’t stop you, nothing and no one stops you. Insistent on beating your high score, days begin to pass and yet you’ve made no progress. Eventually from dehydration and hunger, you have died.'
news = 'You open up the news and the top article is that Elon Musk is now sending cows from earth to the little town he created on Mars named Musktown. What will you do now? 1 for play a phone game or 2 for go get breakfast.'
music = 'You connect your phone to the wireless speakers and you put your playlist on shuffle. Some soothing Frank Sinatra comes on, what a classic! What will you do now? 1 play a phone game, or 2 for go on a jog.'
jog = 'You put on your sports gear and lace up your brand new running shoes. You put in your earphones and go for a jog outside. As you are crossing the street, you’ve already fully embraced yourself in your loud rock music and you become oblivious to your surroundings. As you slowly jog psat the civilian crossing, a car to your left is racing by, though you don’t see or hear it. The car driver was at the time incapacitated and he crashes into you, leading to your death.'
banana = 'You take out a few bananas and begin unpeeling them. After you take all 3 bananas out of their skin, you aim for the trashcan and throw the peels. After adding the needed ingredients in the smoothie, you realize that you forgot to add sugar and you head over to the pantry to retrieve it. Unknowingly, you actually missed your banana peels and you slip and fall to your death.'
apple = 'You blend up a lovely apple smoothie and you drink it the whole thing! You are now full and content. What will you do now? input 1 for go for a jog or input 2 for go on your phone'
