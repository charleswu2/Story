#Final Project Day 4

Today I tried to fix the issues from the previous day. There were some syntax around my if statements for the odd section and I
did some research and troubleshooting to discover that the mistakes I made were quite careless ones. For the if statement, I 
forgot to add the bracket and for the elif statement, I forgot to add the value next to it (for example elif ==2). I mainly
just focused on troubleshooting and fixing some parts of the code that could have been improved. Probably the main roadblock 
today was only locating which line the if and else statements were on - certain if and else statements are spread very far 
apart due to the many choices in between them and aside from that most of the other work went pretty well. My odd section at 
the end of this session was still not finished and I intend on doing that my next session. The work that I did today is below:

(line 110-121) 
        if a == 1:
            print(phone)
            b = input('What will you do on your phone? ')
            b = int(b)
            if b == 1:
                print(game)
            elif b == 2:
                print(news)
                y = input('What will you do now? ')
                y = int(y)
                if y == 1:
                    print(game)
