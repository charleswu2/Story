#Final Project Day 6

Today I finished up my odd section and added comments for the code. Afterwards, I was just mostly testing the code out and
trying each possiblity for the story. I'm pretty happy with the final product and I'm glad that my story is improved and that
everything functions fine. I've also added line breaks to my work to also improve the format and made sure that everything,
including the code and the messages displayed looks good. My final product is below:

#Telling a story from user input

phone = 'You turn on your phone and start scrolling through your notifications from the night before. Please input "1" for a phone game, input "2" to check the news, or "3" to listen to some music.'
game = 'You open your newly downloaded flappy bird game and begin to try beating your high score of 32. You are a determined person and you refuse to give up. After 3 hours have passed, the highest score that you’ve reached is 7. You begin to become frustrated and your eyes begin hurting. But that won’t stop you, nothing and no one stops you. Insistent on beating your high score, days begin to pass and yet you have made no progress. Eventually from dehydration and hunger, you have died. \n \nFeel free to try again and explore alternative posibilities.'
news = 'You open up the news and the top article is that Elon Musk is now sending cows from earth to the little town he created on Mars named Musktown. What will you do now? Input "1" to play a phone game or "2" to go make breakfast.'
music = 'You connect your phone to the wireless speakers and you put your playlist on shuffle. Some soothing Frank Sinatra comes on, what a classic! What will you do now? Input "1" to play a phone game, or "2" to go on a jog.'
jog = 'You put on your sports gear and lace up your brand new running shoes. You put in your earphones and go for a jog outside. As you are crossing the street, you’ve already fully embraced yourself in your loud rock music and you become oblivious to your surroundings. As you slowly jog past the civilian crossing, a car to your left is racing down the road. You were too zoned out in your music you never noticed the wreckless driver! A hit and run, you have died. \n \nFeel free to try again and explore alternative posibilities.'
banana = 'You take out a few bananas and begin unpeeling them. After you take all 3 bananas out of their skin, you aim for the trashcan and throw the peels. After adding the needed ingredients in the smoothie, you realize that you forgot to add sugar and you head over to the pantry to retrieve it. Unknowingly, you actually missed the garbage bin with your banana peels; you slip on them, hitting your head on the edge of a counter. You have died. \n \nFeel free to try again and explore alternative posibilities.'
apple = 'You blend up a lovely apple smoothie and you drink the whole thing! You are now full and content. What will you do now? Please input "1" to go for a jog or input "2" to go on your phone.'
